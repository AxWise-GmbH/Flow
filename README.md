## ü§î What is AxWise Flow?

AxWise Flow is an **AI-powered, open-core platform** built with an **API-first design**. It guides innovators, startups, Product Managers, UX Researchers, and Product Designers through the entire product development lifecycle ‚Äì **from a raw idea or user interview to a validated, actionable plan**. We help you mitigate the risk of building the wrong thing by integrating validation and strategic planning directly into your workflow.

Leveraging 14+ years of product development experience, AxWise Flow provides an **E2E workflow** with semi-automated guardrails to help you:

*   **Ingest & Process Data:** Handle various inputs, including interview transcripts (structured or raw text), user feedback, and initial ideas. Integration with partners like [Vexa.ai](https://github.com/Vexa-ai/vexa) enhances interview processing capabilities.
*   **Analyze & Synthesize:** Automatically extract rich, structured insights including themes (with definitions, keywords, codes, reliability), behavioral patterns (with evidence, impact), sentiment analysis (overall, statements), and pain points.
*   **Generate Personas:** Create detailed, data-driven user personas with evidence-backed traits and confidence scores.
*   **Prioritize & Plan:** Identify key insights ranked by potential impact and generate actionable outputs like user stories and strategic recommendations.
*   **Validate & Iterate:** Structure your validation process and refine your plans based on evidence.

The **core engine, LLM processing logic, prompts, and API** are functional and will be **open-sourced under Apache License 2.0**. This allows enterprises, startups, and individuals to self-host, integrate via API, customize, and benefit from transparency, addressing common concerns with proprietary "black box" analysis tools. A premium SaaS offering will provide a seamless UI, managed infrastructure, and advanced features.

## üöÄ Getting Started

AxWise Flow's core functionalities are operational and accessible via its API. The full open-source core release and the SaaS UI are under active development.

**1. Explore the API:**
*   Our API is functional. Refer to the **[API Documentation](docs/API_DOCS.md)** for details on endpoints and usage.
*   Interested in early API access for integration or partnership? Contact us at [vitalijs@axwise.de](mailto:vitalijs@axwise.de).

**2. Prepare for Self-Hosting (Open Source Core - Coming Soon):**
The open-source core is designed for straightforward self-hosting. The setup will involve:
```shell
# 1. Clone the Repository (This repository!)
git clone https://github.com/AxWise-GmbH/Flow.git
cd Flow

# 2. Configure Environment (.env file: API keys, DB settings, LLM choice)
cp .env.example .env
# ... edit .env with your API keys (Gemini/OpenAI) and database settings ...

# 3. Run using Docker (Recommended for ease of setup - Dockerfile coming soon)
# docker-compose up -d 

# OR Run Manually (See detailed setup in README.md and docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md)
# (Activate Python venv, install requirements, start backend, start frontend)
python start.py # Example unified start script

# 4. Interact via API or integrate with your tools
```
*(**Note:** Detailed self-hosting instructions, including Docker support, will be continuously improved and will accompany the full open-source core release.)*

**3. Stay Updated & Get Involved:**
*   **üåü Star this Repository**: Follow our development progress!
*   **üîî Join the Waitlist**: Be the first to know about the SaaS launch, open-source release, and major updates! üëâ **[https://axwise.de/join-waitlist?source=github](https://axwise.de/join-waitlist?source=github)**
*   **üêû Report Issues:** Found a bug or have a suggestion for the API or core engine? Open an [Issue](https://github.com/AxWise-GmbH/Flow/issues).
*   **üí¨ Discuss:** Join the conversation in our [Discussions](https://github.com/AxWise-GmbH/Flow/discussions) tab.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Example (Conceptual API Interaction)

This example demonstrates a conceptual interaction with the AxWise Flow API. Refer to the **[API Documentation](docs/API_DOCS.md)** for actual endpoint details.

```python
import requests
import json

# Replace with your self-hosted or future SaaS endpoint
API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000" 
# Replace with your actual token (e.g., from Clerk) or API key mechanism
AUTH_TOKEN = "YOUR_CLERK_JWT_OR_API_KEY" 

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {AUTH_TOKEN}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# 1. Upload Interview Data (Example: Raw Text via a dedicated endpoint)
# (Alternatively, use the /api/data endpoint for file uploads)
interview_text = """
User A: The new dashboard is great, much clearer than before.
User A: However, I still can't find the export settings easily. It took me 5 minutes yesterday.
User B: I agree, the main view is better, but finding specific options is a pain point.
"""

# 2. Trigger Analysis (Conceptual - actual endpoint might differ)
# This example assumes an endpoint that accepts raw text directly for analysis.
# The current primary flow involves uploading a file first to get a data_id.
analysis_payload = {
    "text": interview_text, # Sending raw text
    "llm_provider": "gemini", # Or "openai"
    # "analysis_config": { # Optional: further configuration
    #    "tasks": ["themes", "patterns", "sentiment", "personas", "insights", "priority"] 
    # }
}

# Example: Using the direct persona generation endpoint
# For full analysis, you'd typically upload data first, then trigger analysis on the data_id.
# See /api/data and /api/analyze in API_DOCS.md
analysis_response = requests.post(f"{API_BASE_URL}/api/generate-persona", headers=headers, json=analysis_payload)

if analysis_response.status_code == 200:
    analysis_data = analysis_response.json()
    print("Analysis Complete:")
    # Access themes, patterns, personas, insights...
    if analysis_data.get("personas"):
        print(f"- Personas Generated: {len(analysis_data.get('personas', []))}")
        # print(json.dumps(analysis_data.get('personas'), indent=2)) # Print first persona
    else:
        print("No personas generated in this example, full results might be structured differently.")
        # print(json.dumps(analysis_data, indent=2)) # Print full result for inspection
else:
    print(f"Error starting analysis: {analysis_response.status_code} - {analysis_response.text}")

```
*Note: This is a conceptual example. The final API structure and endpoints are detailed in the **[API Documentation](docs/API_DOCS.md)**.*

## üåê Open Source Core & SaaS Model

AxWise Flow operates on an **open-core model**:

*   **Open Source Core (Apache License 2.0):** The fundamental analysis engine, workflow logic, LLM interactions, and API are functional and will be fully open-sourced. This allows for:
    *   **Self-Hosting:** Run the core on your own infrastructure for maximum data control and privacy.
    *   **Transparency:** Understand exactly how your data is processed. No black boxes.
    *   **Customization:** Adapt the core to your specific needs, integrate deeply with internal tools, and use any LLM you prefer.
    *   **Community:** Contribute to and benefit from community improvements and integrations.
*   **Premium SaaS:** A managed cloud offering providing:
    *   A user-friendly web interface for the E2E workflow (Coming Soon).
    *   Simplified setup, maintenance, and scaling.
    *   Advanced collaboration features.
    *   Potentially enhanced AI models or specialized features.

This hybrid approach provides flexibility for enterprises needing control and transparency, while offering convenience and advanced features through the SaaS platform.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

With the core API and analysis features implemented, our focus is on:

*   ‚úÖ **Core Engine & API Functionality:** Implemented and operational.
*   ‚è≥ **Full Open-Source Core Release:** Packaging, documenting, and releasing the core components for easy self-hosting and community contribution.
*   üé® **SaaS UI Development:** Building the intuitive web interface for the E2E workflow.
*   üöÄ **SaaS Platform Launch:** Making AxWise Flow accessible as a managed service via [axwise.de](https://axwise.de/).
*   üß© **Integrations:** Connecting with popular tools (Jira, Figma, Miro, etc.).
*   üîå **Plugin Architecture:** Enabling community extensions and custom workflow steps.
*   üìà **Enhanced AI:** Continuously improving analysis quality (e.g., user story generation, strategic recommendations) and adding more AI-driven guidance.
*   üë• **Community Building:** Fostering an active developer and user community around the open-source project.
